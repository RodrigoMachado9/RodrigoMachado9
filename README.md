### About me
```
I am very curious and I like to create and try innovative solutions. Back-end systems and native cloud applications have been my specialty and I am dedicated to being always up to date on how to create reliable, scalable and high quality APIs based on the microservice architecture.
Since college, the cloud and distributed systems have been my field of choice. I am very lucky to work with something that I am really passionate about.
