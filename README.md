>### About me

My name is Rodrigo Machado, I am very ```curious``` and I like to create and try innovative solutions. ```Back-end systems``` and cloud applications have been my specialty and I am dedicated to being always up to date on how to create reliable, scalable and high quality APIs based on the microservice ```architecture```.
Since college, the cloud and ```distributed systems``` have been my field of choice. I am very lucky to work with something that I am really passionate about.
